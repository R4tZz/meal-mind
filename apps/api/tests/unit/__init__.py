"""
Unit tests for MealMind API.

These tests verify individual components in isolation without
external dependencies like databases, HTTP clients, or file systems.

Unit tests should be:
- Fast (< 1 second per test)
- Isolated (no database, no network)
- Focused (test one thing at a time)

Structure mirrors the application code:
- models/  - Model class tests (enums, validation)
- schemas/ - Pydantic schema tests
- services/ - Business logic tests (with mocked dependencies)
