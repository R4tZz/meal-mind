## Architecture

The frontend follows SvelteKit conventions with:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/           # Page components and API routes
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/             # Reusable components and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ app.html         # HTML template
â””â”€â”€ app.css          # Global styles with Tailwind
```

Built for production deployment with `@sveltejs/adapter-node` for Node.js server environments.
