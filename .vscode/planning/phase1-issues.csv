- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Docker Desktop (or equivalent) is installed and running.
  - The Supabase CLI is installed (**npm install supabase --save-dev** or **brew install supabase/supabase/supabase**).

"Dockerize FastAPI Backend",
"Create the Dockerfile for the FastAPI backend application and configure it.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A **Dockerfile** is created for the FastAPI application within its Nx project directory (e.g., **apps/api/Dockerfile**).
  - The **Dockerfile** uses a Python base image, installs **uv** within the container, and uses **uv** to manage dependencies (e.g., **RUN uv sync --frozen**).
  - A **pyproject.toml** and **uv.lock** file are generated for the FastAPI project to define and lock dependencies using **uv**.",

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A **Dockerfile** is created for the SvelteKit application within its Nx project directory (e.g., **apps/frontend/Dockerfile**).
  - The **Dockerfile** uses a Node.js base image and is set up for a multi-stage build.
  - SvelteKit is configured to use **@sveltejs/adapter-node** for server-side rendering.
  - Tailwind CSS and **shadcn/svelte** are correctly configured within the SvelteKit project.",

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A **docker-compose.yml** file is created at the root of the Nx workspace that orchestrates:
    - Your local Supabase services.
    - Your FastAPI backend application container.
    - Your SvelteKit frontend application container.
  - All containers can be brought up and shut down together using **docker compose up -d** and **docker compose down**.
  - Network configuration ensures inter-container communication via service names.",

"Setup uv for Backend (Host)",
"Install uv globally on your host machine for local Python package management.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - **uv** is installed globally on your host machine (**curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh** or **pip install uv**).",
"phase-1,python",Backlog

"Install Testing Tools (Backend)",
"Install **pytest** and **httpx** as development dependencies for the backend project.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - **pytest** and **httpx** are installed as dev dependencies for the backend project.
  - A minimal **pytest** configuration (e.g., **pytest.ini**) is present.",

"Verify Initial Communication",
"Test that the frontend, backend, and database containers can communicate.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The FastAPI application is configured to connect to the local Supabase PostgreSQL container using environment variables.
  - You can verify that the frontend container can successfully make a simple HTTP request to the backend container.
  - The backend container can successfully connect to the local Supabase PostgreSQL database.
  - Run a simple **nx test frontend** and **nx test api** command, confirming that the test runners execute (even if no meaningful tests are written yet beyond setup confirmation).",
